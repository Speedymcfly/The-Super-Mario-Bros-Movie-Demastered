# Synopsis

Our story begins with Mario Mario & Luigi Mario, who are plumbers, brothers and best friends working in the big city of Brooklyn, New York. After the two were fed up with the working conditions of their boss Spike, quit their jobs and work independently, which is going as bad as you’d expect it to! Things go from bad to worse when after landing a job with Mayor Pauline that would get them on the map, a mysterious flood from the sewers occurs right when they’re on the job, leading to widespread disapproval and backlash from everyone including their own family.

All on their own, the brothers resolve to clear their name and get themselves back on the map by fixing the leak, but things go from worse to awful as Luigi leaves Mario and monsters invade Brooklyn. Now all on his own, Mario tries to fix the leak himself, but finds a mysterious large green pipe, with no other option, he heads inside. He ends in this strange world, filled with Mushrooms. Beforehand he was floating in a Pink void filled with Pipes, with his brother Luigi floating right above him while remaining helpless. Soon, Mario finds a local named Kinopio Flugis Shroomstein or as he would like to be known as “Toad”. Despite his excitable somewhat hyperactively annoying nature, he provides valuable information for Mario that he is the Mushroom Kingdom and his brother has possibly landed in the mysterious Darklands, he resolved to take Mario right away to the Princess as “she can do anything”.

Mario meets with the Princess named Peach Toadstool who reveals that Luigi has ended up in Bowser’s domain, the evil ruthless King of the Koopas who with his wizardly adviser and father figure, Kamek, and his council, the Elite Trio (Who bicker over who deserves to be promoted to Emperor) plan to rule the world using the 6 Power Stars and secretly, force his hand in marriage with Princess Peach. She tells Mario that it is only a matter of time before something bad happens to him. What makes matters worse is that Bowser has already found one of the Power Stars in the remains of Cool Cool City and would be sure to find the remaining five he has to collect to ensure unlimited power.

Riddled with guilt, Mario wants Peach to take him to save Luigi, but Peach, thinking the Plumber is unfit for venturing out and possibly getting himself hurt, declines. But after a lengthy training session and seeing potential in the plucky plumber, she accepts. They soon strike a deal where Mario would help Peach with her Bowser problem and Peach would help Mario find Luigi.

Joined by Toad, the trio embark on a sprawling adventure across scorching deserts and lush beaches of Sarasaland, tranquil Fire Flower meadows, the food dinosaur-filled tropical landscape of Yoshi’s Island, Kongo Bongo's bustling jungle metropolis ruled by the crankiest ape alive, and even the glittering Roads of Rainbows. With the assistance of Princess Peach and budding friendship with Toad, Mario taps into his own power as they resolve to find the Power Stars, create a resistance to protect the Mushroom Kingdom, and stop Bowser's plans of world domination. Meanwhile, Luigi, alongside his fellow prisoners must hatch a daring escape plan where he must find his true resolve to become the person he and his brother aspires him to be.

# FAQ

**How long is the game?** <br>
Around 5-7 Hours purely by just playing the main story, with each character challenge mode section taking at least an hour to complete. Going for 100% (Beating the game, Collecting 78 Green Stars, Getting the Good Ending and beating all of Challenge Mode) will be around 10-15 Hours.

**How many cutscenes are there?** <br>
Too many

**Why have you changed so much from the movie?** <br>
I really wanted to rewrite the story and do the movie again so to speak, giving my own take on what would happen without any restrictions from being a movie while refining details and adding new ones. Also the game would be pretty short if it was only just the base events \:P (I also did not rewatch the movie once while making the game)

**How long did the project take to make?** <br>
Around two years ago, I initially started this game in October of 2023 as a proof of concept/feasibility test for the engine before it launched into full production in February 2024. This was a solo project done by mostly me, alongside 3 Pixel artists and two artists who made key art for the game!

**Android, Mac etc port?** <br>
No, at least for Android, the game at the moment is incompatible with Winlator and doesn't have an version specifically exported to Mac, however you can try Wine to see if the game works on MacOs

**Multiplayer for the whole game?** <br>
No, the game is unfeasible with whole game multiplayer which was planned, but ended up being cut.I prefer it as a side activity anyway and depending on the reception, will be recceiving more levels and updates.

**What Post Launch Content will be available?** <br>
Mainly a plethora of new modes upon completing the game, modes such as Time Trials and Coin Rush will be added, alongside the Special world, New Game Plus with harder levels, Movie Accurate Mode which goes solely removes any new story content added to the game and Marathon Mode, which is essentially a campaign select for each character featuring new levels and cutscenes. Along with that are new Challenge Mode stages with new objectives and new Multiplayer levels. Some of these were cut due to launch however will be added back with possible monthly content updates starting in January. No additional story content is planned for the game, since what I had planned is too large in scope for DLC. Post Launch content will be available to download with every patch the game receives on Itch.io and Game Jolt!

**The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Demastered?** <br>
To be honest it really depends on a lot of factors when it comes to a sequel, since I made this game as a fun way to rewrite and adapt the movie into a game. If the sequel doesn't have as major story problems as this movie did, I will be less inlined to work on it especially with them going onto Galaxy this soon. I do however have a general interest in making a sequel but I'd also want it to be different enough to justify it's existence. One thing I will say is that it definitely won't be as ambitious as this game in terms of content and story. However, in terms of spin-offs, stay tuned.

**Will the game be struck down by the Nintendo Ninjas?** <br>
Very unlikely, Nintendo seemingly only goes for major fan projects that conflict with current releases such as remakes or similar games in concept. However, there is a very slight chance the game could be due to use of assets from the movie such as Concept Art and Music. However I'd say it's unlikely overall.
